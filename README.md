# Technical-Indicators-Project
Project Overview
This project is a Python framework for backtesting and evaluating technical trading indicators using historical stock data. It helps users determine the most effective indicators and parameters by simulating trades and calculating a profit rate, rather than just predictive accuracy.

Key Features
Data Handling: Loads and cleans CSV data, handling different formats.

Indicators: Includes functions for Bollinger Bands, MACD, RSI, SMA, and EMA.

Backtesting: Simulates trades to calculate a profit rate.

Optimization: Automatically finds the best parameters for each indicator.

Reporting: Summarizes the performance (accuracy and profit) of all indicators.
